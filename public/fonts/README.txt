Place licensed font files here (WOFF2 preferred for production).

Suggested filenames (match accessible-fonts.css):
- Atkinson-Hyperlegible-Regular.woff2
- Atkinson-Hyperlegible-Bold.woff2
- OpenDyslexic-Regular.woff2
- OpenDyslexic-Bold.woff2

Only Atkinson Hyperlegible and OpenDyslexic are included by default. Remove other font files unless you have explicit license/hosting requirements.

After adding, update CSS @font-face src paths if filenames differ.
