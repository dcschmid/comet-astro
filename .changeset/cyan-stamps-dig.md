We refreshed the component library and docs to align with WCAG AAA standards across light and dark themes, tightening color palettes, focus rings, and hover states for buttons, badges, banners, blockquotes, breadcrumbs, and back-to-top controls; added reduced-motion fallbacks and automatic external-link cues; updated the documentation shell for higher contrast and better navigation; and rewrote each componentâ€™s guide with richer examples, prop explanations, and accessibility guidance so the entire system now offers consistent, high-contrast, keyboard-friendly experiences.
